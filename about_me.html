        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in Beijing China. I first came to the US in
          2018 and had been living and studying in California since.

          While I studied psychology as an undergraduate, I am currently
          working towards a masterâ€™s degree in computer science and aspiring
          to become a software engineer in the near future.

          I have many go-tos in my leisure time. My favorite is bouldering
          right now.
