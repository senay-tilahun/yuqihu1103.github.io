Project Description:

As an MSCS student with a passion for web development and a diverse range of skills and interests,
I am embarking on the creation of my personal homepage. This project aims to design and develop a
user-friendly, informative, and visually appealing website that serves as a digital representation
of myself, showcasing my academic journey, skills, projects, hobbies, and contact information.

field of computer science. This includes programming languages, software tools, and any specialized
knowledge acquired during my studies.

2. Academic Overview: Provide a concise summary of my academic journey, including my current MSCS
program, relevant courses, research interests, and academic achievements.

3. Project Portfolio: Showcase a curated selection of my most significant and relevant projects.
Each project will include descriptions, technologies used, and links to view or access the
project, where applicable.

4. Hobbies and Interests: Highlight my personal hobbies and interests, helping visitors to get to
know me beyond my academic and professional pursuits.

5. Contact Information: Ensure easy accessibility by providing contact information, including
email and social media profiles, for anyone interested in reaching out or connecting with me.

Technologies and Tools:
